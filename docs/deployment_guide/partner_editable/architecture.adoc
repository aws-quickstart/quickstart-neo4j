.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/neo4j_architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones  in your default virtual private cloud (VPC).
* In the public subnets:*
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways in all three Availability Zones to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instances in all three Availability Zones with {partner-product-short-name} installed and configured in an Auto Scaling group for external access. Within this database management system (DBMS) cluster, each instance has either a leader or a follower https://medium.com/neo4j/querying-neo4j-clusters-7d6fde75b5b4[cluster role^].
** Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) gp3 volumes in all three Availability Zones to store the Neo4j database.

[.small]#* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with {partner-product-short-name}, this Quick Start deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Quick Start in a production environment, consider using a private subnet. A private subnet limits how you access the Neo4j application and Neo4j Browser over the public internet.
