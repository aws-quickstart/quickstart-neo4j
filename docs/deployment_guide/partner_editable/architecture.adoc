As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways in all three Availability Zones to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instances with {partner-product-short-name} installed and configured in an Auto Scaling group for external access.

WARNING: This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^].

NOTE: By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with {partner-product-short-name}, this Quick Start deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Quick Start in a production environment, consider using a private subnet. A private subnet limits how you access the {partner-product-short-name} browser and application over the public internet. For information on accessing the {partner-product-short-name} browser and application, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html[Connect your VPC to remote networks^].

//TODO Suresh, We say "browser" and "application" elsewhere, and we don't use the term "driver" anywhere else. So I swapped in "application" in this note. Is that accurate? Or do we need to revert to "driver" here?

//TODO Suresh, Please fill in the blanks above.

//TODO Suresh, Which components comprise the "database management system (DBMS) cluster" that we refer to later? We should clarify this here.
