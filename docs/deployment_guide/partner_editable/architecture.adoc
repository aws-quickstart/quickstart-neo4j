WARNING: This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^].

Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/neo4j_aws_3_node_marketplace.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start deploys the following cloud resources:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones in a new virtual private cloud (VPC).
* An Internet Gateway
* Three public subnets (distributed accross the 3 AZs), with the following address ranges:
** 10.0.1.0/24
** 10.0.2.0/24
** 10.0.3.0/24
* Security Groups 
* The required Routing Tables and Subnet Associations
* 1, or between 3 and 10 EC2 instances (depending on whether a single instance, or an autonomous cluster is selected)
* 1 Network (Layer 4) Load Balancer
* An EC2 Auto Scailing Group (ASG) and associated launch configuration

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instances are deployed evenly across each of the 3 subnets (by the ASG) and are configured as {partner-product-short-name} instances, in a Autonomous Cluster configuration.  

[.small]#* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with {partner-product-short-name}, this Quick Start deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Quick Start in a production environment, consider using a private subnet. A private subnet limits how you access the Neo4j application and Neo4j Browser over the public internet.
