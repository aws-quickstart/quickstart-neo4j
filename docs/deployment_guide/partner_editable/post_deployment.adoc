== Postdeployment steps

Test the deployment as follows:

. This quickstart deploys three EC2 nodes. You can connect to any of the nodes made available from the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console]. If a node goes down you can connect to a different node and use the web interface on that node.

. In a web browser, go to `\http://<your server>:7474` OR `\https://<your server>:7473`, replacing <your server> with the name of with either the public IP address or DNS name of your EC2 instance.

. Log in to the Neo4j application with the user name `neo4j` and the password that you supplied during the deployment.

. Run `CALL dbms.cluster.overview()` to check the status of the DBMS cluster. Information appears about each member of the cluster, as shown in <<dbms-cluster-overview>>.
