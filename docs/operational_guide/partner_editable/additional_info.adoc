CAUTION: Note that this Quick Start deploys in the default VPC in a public subnet to give better user experience in getting started with {partner-product-short-name}. If you are deploying this Quick Start in production environment, you may want to consider using a private subnet. But that limits how you access the {partner-product-short-name} browser and driver over public internet. In that case, you need to use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html[VPN] to access the {partner-product-short-name} browser and driver. If you want to see the Quick Start deployed to private subnet or other deployment model you can create feature request via github issues on the Quick Start https://github.com/{quickstart-github-org}/{quickstart-project-name}/issues/[GitHub repository^].
